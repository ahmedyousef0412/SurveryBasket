Why use serilog?
 Serilog promotes structured logging, where log events are represented as objects with named properties.
 This makes your logs more readable, searchable, and easier to analyze with tools.
 Compared to traditional string-based logging, 
 structured logs provide a clearer understanding of what's happening in your application.
